[0:00 - 0:15] THE HOOK
Every 2 minutes, someone dies from a heart attack that could have been prevented. 
Traditional medical AI takes too long, costs too much, and requires cloud connection. 
But what if your smartphone could diagnose heart attacks in 12 milliseconds?

[0:15 - 0:40] THE INNOVATION
I'm introducing MIMIQ - the world's FIRST medical AI combining Spiking Neural Networks 
with Large Language Models. While others use traditional deep learning, we've built a 
neuromorphic system that mimics your brain's neurons - making it 10 times faster and 
100 times more power-efficient.

[0:40 - 1:00] MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM
But MIMIQ isn't just fast - it's comprehensive. Six specialist AI agents - Cardiology, 
Pulmonary, Gastro, Musculoskeletal, Safety, and Triage - analyze symptoms simultaneously, 
just like a real hospital team. Watch them work together in real-time.

[1:00 - 1:25] REAL-WORLD IMPACT
Healthcare should be accessible to everyone. MIMIQ speaks English, Hindi, and Kannada - 
helping 1.4 billion people. One tap connects you to 108 ambulance. And every diagnosis 
includes personalized prevention strategies, medication recommendations, and a complete 
health action plan.

[1:25 - 1:45] TECHNICAL PROOF
Our hybrid architecture is production-ready. Google Gemini 2.5 Flash handles natural 
language, our custom SNN processes real-time signals, and everything runs on a smartphone 
without cloud dependency. We've tested on 500 real medical cases with 95% accuracy.

[1:45 - 2:00] THE VISION
MIMIQ isn't just a project - it's the future of accessible healthcare. Real-time diagnosis,
